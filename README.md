### Bedwars Event Changes.
This New Year's Eve I noticed a lot of new events on Roblox. Currently I normally just play Bedwars so let me tell what happened in Bedwars:
1. The Title Changed: Before the Bedwars title was Bedwars(❄Winter Bundle). Now it's Bedwars(🎉New Year's Eve).
2. New Lucky Block: Before there were only four types of Lucky Blocks(Normal, Airdrop, Cosmic, and Huge). Now there are five types of Lucky Block(Normal, Airdrop, New Year's Eve, Cosmic, and Huge).
3. New Free Kits: To celebrate the new year this week there are three new kits: Archer, Builder, and Grim Reaper(for some reason).
4. Prizes Everywhere: Now every hour until New Year's Day there is a huge drop of free items this includes the new items.
