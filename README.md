# 🎉🥳🎊New Year's Eve🎉🥳🎊(2022 Only For Now)
## 2022: Events, Events, Events! Catergory: Bedwars
### Bedwars Event Changes.
This New Year's Eve I noticed a lot of new events on Roblox. Currently I normally just play Bedwars so let me tell what happened in Bedwars:
1. The Title Changed: Before the Bedwars title was Bedwars(❄Winter Bundle). Now it's Bedwars(🎉New Year's Eve).
2. New Lucky Block: Before there were only four types of Lucky Blocks(Normal, Airdrop, Cosmic, and Huge). Now there are five types of Lucky Block(Normal, Airdrop, New Year's Eve, Cosmic, and Huge). New Years lucky block was later discontiued!
3. New Free Kits: To celebrate the new year this week there are three new kits: Archer, Builder, and Grim Reaper(for some reason).
4. Prizes Everywhere: Now every hour until New Year's Day there is a huge drop of free items this includes the new items.
5. New Items: In the last change in Bedwars I talked about new items. The new items all have to do with New Year's Stuff. Example: Sparkler.

### Bedwars Changes Overall
So now we will talk about what did the bedwars players do.
1. Grim Reaper Everywhere: Relating to the new kits many people choose Grim Reaper. This may relate to Grim Reapers popularity around kids. Or just that the kit skin looks good.
2. Newbies Join: Seeing as the title changed, many new people joined not really knowing how to play the game. Bruh Momments. I saw at least two different players jump into the void for no reason. Plus in the chat a bunch of people said "How do I play this game." Me be like "How did you join this game in the first place?". Them No Longer Uses The Chat Function
3. Lucky Block Flooded: Tens of thousands of people joined Lucky Block for the Lucky Block Ball Drop and the New Year's Lucky Block.
